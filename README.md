# Creating your first satellite image

In this hands-on training, you'll learn how to find, download, combine, and turn data captured by satellites into ready-for-publication images. You'll learn three ways to do this by using point and click tools, command line and Google Earth Engine.

## First things first

Request access to Google Earth Engine code environment

https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/

Whoops, you need to download this file and put it in the LC80230312014138LGN00 folder.

Navigate to the session folder and run this command

`landsat download LC80230312014138LGN00 --bands BQA -d ./`

## Where does this data come from

- [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)
- [Landsat Util](https://pythonhosted.org/landsat-util/)
- [libra.developmentseed.org](https://libra.developmentseed.org)

## Point and click with photoshop

1. Open the three images in photoshop
	You want the X_B2.tif X_B3.tif and X_B4.tif files 

2. Open the channels panel

3. Click the menu button on that panel and select "Merge Channels..."

4. Select "RGB Color" from mode, and keep channels at 3, click okay

5. Specify your channels 
	* Red: X_B4.tif
	* Blue: X_B3.tif
	* Green: X_B2.tif

	Click OK

6. Your image is really dark. Lighten it up by going to `Image > Adjustments > Levels`
	take the white carrot and drag it to the edge of the histogram, click okay

7. Open the layers panel, create a new Curves adjustment layer by clicking the half-filled circle button at the bottom of the panel.

8. Zoom to something that looks like it's white, click the white eye dropper in the panel, then click the white area perhaps a cloud or building roof.

9. In panel, select each channel from the RGB drop down, and drag the black carrot for each to the point on the histogram where the curve gets steep.

10. Switch back to the RGB view in the histogram and pull the middle of the white line up

## On the command line with landsat-util

1. Open up the command line and navigate to the folder with your images

2. run `landsat process LC80230312014138LGN00 --pansharpen --bands 432`

3. your file is now at TK


## Using Google Earth Engine


1. Navigate to https://code.earthengine.google.com/

2. Create a new script

3. Pick a point you want to focus on

4. Define your parameters

```
var o = {
  start: ee.Date('2013-01-01'),
  finish: ee.Date('2018-03-10'),
  target: geometry,
  cloud_cover_lt: 0.8,
  bands:["B4", "B3", "B2"],
  projection: "EPSG:3394"
}
```

5. Load all of the landsat scenes

```
var filteredCollection = ee.ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_RT")
```

6. Filter to the one that is over your point

```
var filteredCollection = ee.ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_RT")
  .filterBounds(o.target)

```


7. Limit to those that have low cloud coverage

```
var filteredCollection = ee.ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_RT")
  .filterBounds(o.target)
  .filterMetadata("CLOUD_COVER", "less_than", o.cloud_cover_lt)
```

8. Pick the most recent of those

```
var scene = ee.Image(filteredCollection.sort("DATE_ACQUIRED", false).first());
```

9. Set your parameters based on the data

```

# Either

var params = {
  bands: o.bands,
  max: [10000,10000,10000],
  min: [1000,1000,1000])
}

#####

# or more complexly

var bandMax = filteredCollection.median()
    .reduceRegion({
      geometry: o.target,
      reducer: ee.Reducer.max(),
      scale: 60,
      tileScale: 16
    })
    
  var bandMin = filteredCollection.median()
    .reduceRegion({
      geometry: o.target,
      reducer: ee.Reducer.min(),
      scale: 60,
      tileScale: 16
    })


var params = {
  bands: o.bands,
  max: o.bands.map(function(b){return bandMax.get(b).getInfo() * 1.5}),
  min: o.bands.map(function(b){return bandMin.get(b).getInfo() * 0.15})
}

####
```

10. Plot your scene in the environment

```
Map.addLayer(scene, params)
```

11. Save to your google drive as a jpeg

```
Export.image.toDrive({
    image: scene.select(o.bands).reproject(o.projection),
    description: "my_scene_from_nicar",
    scale: 30,
  })
```
